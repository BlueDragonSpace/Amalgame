Started Project, found Hack Club JumpStart (program for making games)
Basic infrastructure

(7/16/2025)
Framework and basic background things were created... Basic Player (lol can't move yet), 
Pause, other UI, Weapon and Entity (and Enemy) abstract classes, a basic Axe weapon is virtually completed, 
and the action of Attacking (at least with melee weapons) has been created.

Learned stuff on Godot Themes and class_names.
