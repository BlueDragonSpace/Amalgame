Should be working on the Shovel Jam...
I do feel bad about leaving behind my team... but where did Wheels go?
It also feels like half of us don't have motivation for the project...
Or maybe that's how I'm just seeing it, but it seems like little progress has been made in 3 days...

Shovel did say to "Just Get Started", though. This is my dream game's prequel, sort of like Dragon's Game

I also need to put a .gitignore file on this... and I shouldn't post this to Github, at least not yet.
Not before the jam is over...
