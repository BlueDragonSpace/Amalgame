Need:
	
	GitHub this thing so I can start anew with physics simulations
	Alternate path?: Getting Over It, but with combat!
	
	Knockback (away from player, weapon, or [hard] weapon velocity)
	Gun
	
Want:
	Sword (pokes)
	Shovel (digs for projectiles)
	Timestop, screenshake, bubble (num!), particles vfx on Good Hits
	Random Damage offsets
	Balancing: Active Weapon frames
	Death particle vfx
	
	Execptionally slow gun: Enemy drop, same gun as enemies


Game breaking things:
	velocity_offset is only for enemies
	Knockback is reset every time there is new knockback (instead add to velocity_offset?)
	Collision layers are set really weird, but account for area2Ds apparently not detecting area2Ds
